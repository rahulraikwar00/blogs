If you ask people what they like about democratic structures, whether governments, workplaces, or blockchain-based DAOs, you will often hear the same arguments: they avoid concentration of power, they give their users strong guarantees because there isn't a single person who can completely change the system's direction on a whim, and they can make higher-quality decisions by gathering the perspectives and wisdom of many people.
